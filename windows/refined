Remove the Password from the inventory file (Optional)
======================================================
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/getting_started/first_inventory.html#protecting-sensitive-variables-with-ansible-vault
======================================================================================================================================
To make the Ansible code safe from a security point of view, we need to remove the password for the Windows Administrator.
We'll use Ansible-vault to encrypt the password and move the password into a specific variables file. We'll also create another file outside of our Ansible code to hold the vault password (The password used by Ansible to decrypt the password)
Create a variable file to hold the password. I’ll do it in the default location. Win is the group name so if we create a win.yml, any variables will get picked up by the win group in the inventory :

mkdir group_vars
vi group_vars/win.yml

Encrypt the password string:
ansible-vault encrypt_string 'Administrator_user_password' --name ansible_password

USE PASSWORD: Password123

Take the output and add it to group_vars/win.yml

Because the variable is in the default location (group_vars) it will be picked up in the run because it’s called win.yml – it’s a group variable.

Remove the password from the inventory file. * Delete the password line from the hosts.ini file.

Run the playbook.

ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini windows.yml --ask-vault-pass Enter the password to open the vault.

Finally, add the vault password to a file and reference it in ansible.cfg file.
vi open_vault.txt
Password123

vi ansible.cfg
[defaults]
vault_password_file= open_vault.txt
Re-run Ansible but this time remove ask-vault-pass.
ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini windows.yml

Issue:
